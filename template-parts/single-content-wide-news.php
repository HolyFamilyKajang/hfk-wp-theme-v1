        Our Heavenly Father is the quintessential example of the selflessness of fathers when He sacrificed His only son, our
        Lord Jesus Christ, for our salvation and the atonement of our sins.  For Father’s Day, two Holy Family
        parishioners share with us their memories and experiences with their fathers.

                My father has been a constant source of love, support,
                encouragement and advice. I’ve learnt many valuable
                lessons from his countless analogies and pep talks, and
                we’ve engaged in playful banter and shared so many
                jokes between us; both undeniably hilarious and
                laughably bad. I grew up a daddy’s girl, and some of the
                best moments I’ve experienced have been by his side.

                Work can be time-consuming and stressful, but my father
                always made sure to carve time out of his busy schedule
                to spend with me. When I was younger, that time would
                have been spent play-acting with my dolls in high-pitched
                voices, earning squeals of laughter from me, but as I
                grew older, we often spent that time talking and joking
                around.

                He was there to witness every small step I took - from my
                first word to the first story I’d ever written. My father has
                always taken such pride in what I do. Never once has he
                expressed that he would rather have me be more
                ambitious than simply aspiring to be a writer. I vividly
                remember bringing him a few sheets of paper; my messy
                cursive scrawl inked into the margins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether or not the story I’d written was actually worth the
                attention of any publisher or renowned critic, my father
                read every sentence with affectionate warmth in his eyes,
                letting me know afterward that I was his favourite writer. I
                know that without the constant reminder of my father to
                never settle for any less than I am capable of, I would
                have long since given up on my dreams to become a
                writer.

                If I had to pick one of my favourite teachings from my
                father, it would be that life is way too short and
                unpredictable for us to spend it dwelling on emotions like
                anger, hatred, bitterness and resentment that draw us
                further away from the ones we love.

                My dad was a strict man, he was always well dressed but
                surprisingly always with a smile too. All my childhood
                friends who met him loved him instantly. That annoyed
                me because I thought he was too strict with us, especially
                with my brother. I was his youngest and probably his
                favourite, with him giving me, and only me, a nickname
                which was ‘Chinni’ meaning cute or little one.
            </p>
            <p>
                He never differentiated me from my brother, teaching the
                both of us the same things, especially about cars which
                were his passion! He taught me how to check the engine
                oil, the spark plug, to push start a car, etc. I knew more
                about cars than my husband did. He also taught me how
                to make a top and play it and how to make kite and fly it.

                He was an active outdoorsy man, whom I was glad to
                follow to avoid the chores in the kitchen. His best gift to
                me was teaching me badminton. He would do a body
                smash and scold me for not returning it and believe it or
                not, I was able to take any smash after that. This didn’t
                make me a national player, but I won many titles in
                badminton tournaments during my working days.
            </p>
            <p>
                I cannot recall a single day of him missing Sunday mass.
                Even when he was home bound, he insisted that the
                priest visit him once a month for communion. He was
                always ever ready to serve in the church. I do believe my
                passion to serve the church comes from watching him
                serve and the joy it brought him. He passed down his
                passion and faith to me, and I am grateful for it, as it now
                gives me great joy too.

                My dad went to be with the Lord on May 13, 2019. I am
                assured that my dad lived a good life and was a good
                son, husband and definitely a good father. Thank you
                Appa and may you rest in peace and rise in glory!
